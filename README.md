LinkedIn Connector Chrome Extension
This Chrome extension automates sending connection requests on LinkedIn. It uses the wxt.dev framework with React to provide a smooth user experience and includes a floating "Connect with All" button to automatically send connection requests to all visible profiles.

Features
Floating Button: A button is displayed on the LinkedIn "Grow your network" page.
Automated Connect Requests: Clicking the button sends connection requests to all visible profiles on the page.
Delay Between Requests: A random delay of 1-3 seconds is added between requests to avoid LinkedIn blocking the account.
Edge Case Handling: Alerts the user if no "Connect" buttons are found.
Tech Stack
React: For building the user interface.
wxt.dev: A framework for building Chrome extensions with React.
JavaScript (Content Scripts): To interact with LinkedIn’s page and send connection requests.

Code Walkthrough
manifest.json
Defines the Chrome extension settings, including:

The content script (content.js) that interacts with LinkedIn.
The background script (background.js) to manage background tasks.
Permissions for accessing active tabs and using scripting APIs.
UI popup file (popup.html).
content.js
This script is responsible for automating the connection requests on LinkedIn. It:

Selects all the "Connect" buttons on the page.
Clicks them one by one with a random delay (1-3 seconds).
Handles the case where no connectable profiles are found, showing an alert to the user.
popup.js
Responsible for rendering the React components in the popup. React’s ReactDOM is used to render the app inside the popup.

background.js
The background script is used for handling background operations (like managing state or events that don't require direct user interaction).

Known Issues
If LinkedIn’s layout changes, the extension might fail to detect "Connect" buttons.
LinkedIn may block accounts if the extension sends too many connection requests in a short period. A longer delay between requests can help mitigate this.
